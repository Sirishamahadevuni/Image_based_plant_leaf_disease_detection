Agriculture is important for India. Every year growing variety of crops is at loss due to
 inefficiency in shipping, cultivation, pest infestation in crop and storage of government
subsidized crops. There is reduction in production of good crops in both quality and quantity due
 to Plants being affected by diseases. Hence it is important for early detection and identification
 of diseases in plants.The Deep learning algorithm is used for plant disease recognition and
 classification problems. Deep learning approach presents to detect the plant disease and classify
 the type of disease. Using continuous image capturing the autonomous agriculture vehicles
 accurately locate psychopathological problem in large cultivation field. The type of disease and
 disease harshness in plants can be identified by feature extraction and machine learning. The
 success of machine learning is train an algorithm by access the large amount of data and graphics
 processing unit (GPU) provides high computation power to achieve the parallelism in data
 computing.
 The proposed methodology consists of collection of Plant leaf dataset, Image preprocessing,
 Image Augmentation and Neural network training. The dataset is collected from ImageNet for
 training phase. The CNN technique is used to differentiate the healthy leaf from disease affected
 leaf. In image preprocessing resizing the image is carried out to reduce the training phase time.
 Image augmentation is performed in training phase by applying various transformation function
 on Plant images. The Network is trained by Caffenet deep learning framework. CNN is trained
 with ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit). The convolution base of CNN generates features from image
 through the multiple convolution layers and pooling layers. The classifier part of CNN classifies
 the image based on the features extracted from the convolution base. The classification is
 performed through the fully connected layers. The performance is measured using 10-fold cross
 validation function. The final layer uses activation function like softmax to categorize the outputs.
